    - Digital reports are automatically uploaded to the patient's profile and sent for the doctor's review.

6.  **X-Rays and Scans at Home:**
    - Partnership with mobile diagnostic service providers to offer on-demand X-rays, ECGs, and other scans at home, particularly for elderly or immobile patients.

7.  **Medicine Delivery at Home:**
    - An integrated e-pharmacy service where patients can upload a prescription (or use one generated on the platform) to order medicines for doorstep delivery.

8.  **Covid-19 Self-Test & Checkup Plans:**
    - A guided self-assessment tool based on WHO/CDC guidelines.
    - Options to order approved home test kits and book structured post-illness recovery and checkup plans.

9.  **Fast Responses & 24x7 Availability:**
    - A dedicated 24x7 support system and a one-tap SOS feature for emergencies.
    - AI-powered triage bot to handle initial queries and direct users to the appropriate service.

10. **Downloadable PDF Reports:**
    - All documents—prescriptions, lab reports, consultation summaries, and invoices—are available to download as professionally formatted PDFs, making them easy to store, print, and share.

## 4. User Roles & Flow

- **Patient:** Registers -> Searches for doctor/service -> Books appointment/service -> Pays online -> Attends consultation/receives service -> Accesses reports/prescriptions -> Orders medicine.
- **Doctor:** Registers & gets verified -> Sets availability -> Receives booking notification -> Conducts consultation -> Issues prescription/report -> Receives payment.
- **Lab Technician:** Receives assigned booking -> Travels to patient's home -> Collects sample -> Submits sample to the lab.
- **Delivery Agent:** Receives delivery order -> Picks up medicine from pharmacy -> Delivers to patient's address.

## 5. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js with React (TypeScript) for a fast, server-rendered, and responsive UI.
- **UI Components:** ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible, and consistent design system.
- **Backend & AI:** Genkit (running on Google Cloud) for creating and managing AI flows, server-side logic, and business operations.
- **AI/ML Models:** Google's Gemini models for symptom analysis, diagnostic support, and predictive analytics. OCR technology for prescription scanning.
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore for a scalable, real-time, NoSQL database to store user data, appointments, and health records.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication for secure user login and identity management.
- **File Storage:** Google Cloud Storage for securely storing medical images, reports, and other documents.
- **Real-Time Communication (Video/Chat):** WebRTC for secure, peer-to-peer audio/video calls and Firebase for real-time chat.
